	<h1> LOCKDOWN Due to COVID-19</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>When a complex and unclear threat is unfolding, you can see the appeal of a lockdown to those in power. It reframes disease control in terms of restrictions on movement and contact. Messy narratives about health infrastructure, testing, tracing, monitoring, probabilities, education, research and so forth, are replaced with a list of rules, responsibilities and consequences. The relationship between authorities and people is simplified: the authorities enforce the rules, the people comply.</p>

	<p>As the national picture becomes increasingly complicated, the Centre takes on a more symbolic and supervisory role. Dashboards of “performance” in different states shift perceptions of responsibility and place pressure on state governments. It is they who become the villains when there is failure to control the disease, even where national policy may be to blame. The blame game encourages states to manipulate data including finding ways to underreport Covid-19 infections and deaths.</p>

	<p>The first lockdown effect, a slowdown in transmission, occurs via a reduction in those day-to-day events which spread disease. This can be modelled simply as a reduction in the probability of infection events occurring. It should manifest in the data after a delay. If transmissions are cut in half today, and testing typically occurs 10 days after infection, then 10 days from now recorded infections will start to slow. About 18 days from now, we will see deaths start to slow.</p>

	<p> The second lockdown effect – geographical localisation – can be modelled most simply as a reduction in the effective population where disease is able to spread. Of course, localisation can never be perfect: disease leaks – across state boundaries, within a town, or even within an urban neighbourhood. Nevertheless, after lockdown begins, we expect fewer outbreaks in new localities. The outbreaks which fail to occur would take time to become numerically significant – hence, their absence takes time to be visible in data. We see clearly the signature of localisation in the flat data curves of outbreaks which have effectively been controlled such as that in Germany.</p>
