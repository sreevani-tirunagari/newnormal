		<center>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic has changed, and will continue to change, the world and the way we work, rest and play. As public places begin to re-open,it is important to know that the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 is still very real. It is okay and normal to feel more nervous or anxious while out in public. High-risk populations (age 65+, immunocompromised or other medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled) must be protected. While re-introducing people and places to your daily life, remember that it is still important to take precautions. Use caution and good judgment anytime you are out in public to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy and safe. If you don't feel comfortable attending social events or gatherings with family and friends, tell them so and offer to visit virtually instead. If you do choose to gather in small groups, remember social distancing, face coverings and hand washing are all still very important to help prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear a face covering in public places. Wearing a face covering is mandatory in some places and recommended by the CDC when social distancing isn't possible.

					Make only essential shopping trips. The purpose of shelter in place and stay at home efforts is to keep you from transmitting the virus to others or acquiring it yourself. Arrive with a list and don't spend unneeded time inside stores. Avoid handling items you will not be purchasing.
					
					Social distance as much as possible. Social distancing means anything from refraining from seeing friends and family in person outside your home to keeping distance between you and others when you do go out to the store or for a walk. Practice keeping six feet away from those outside your home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<br>
	<p>During the COVID-19 public health emergency, entities that are not currently registered drug manufacturers can register as over-the-counter (OTC) drug manufacturers and make alcohol-based hand sanitizers, pharmacies and registered outsourcing facilities can compound certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and alcohol production firms can produce alcohol for making hand sanitizers provided they follow the conditions outlined in many industries. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the trend toward a cashless economy, financial experts say, buoyed by the growth of e-commerce and the fear of handling paper money contaminated with COVID-19.</p>
